On the other hand, many managers—presidents, generals, governors,\nsupervisors—have been successful even with inadequate plans, organizations, or controls\nbecause they had the knack of hiring the right people for the right jobs and motivating,\nappraising, and developing them. The direct handling of people is an integral part of every line\nmanager's duties.

Staff managers are authorized to assist and\nadvise line managers in accomplishing these basic goals.

In the staff (assist and advise) function, HR managers assist in hiring, training,\nevaluating, rewarding, counseling, promoting, and firing employees.

These establish centralized HR units whose employees are shared\nby all the companies' departments to obtain advice on matters such as discipline problems. The\nshared services HR teams offer their services through intranets or centralized call centers; they\naim to provide managers and employees with specialized support in day-to-day HR activities\n(such as discipline problems).

Discuss at least 3\ntechnologies that have had an impact.\nAnswer: Five main types of digital technologies are driving this transfer of functionality from\nHR professionals to automation. Employers increasingly use social media tools such as Twitter,\nFacebook, and LinkedIn (rather than, say, as many employment agencies) to recruit new\nemployees. Employers use new mobile applications, for instance, to monitor employee location\nand to provide digital photos at the facility clock-in location to identify workers. The feedback,\nfun, and objectives inherent in gaming support many new training applications, and Web sites\nsuch as Knack, Gild, and True Office enable employers to inject gaming features into training,\nperformance appraisal, and recruiting. Cloud computing and more intuitive user interfaces enable\nemployers to monitor and report on things like a team's goal attainment and to provide real-time\nevaluative feedback. Finally, data analytics basically means using statistical techniques,\nalgorithms, and problem-solving to identify relationships among data for the purpose of solving\nparticular problems (such as what are the ideal candidate's traits, or how can I tell in advance\nwhich of my best employees is likely to quit?) When applied to human resource management,\ndata analytics is called talent analytics.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 1\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Application of Knowledge\nLearning Outcome: 1.2 Briefly discuss and illustrate each of the important trends influencing\nhuman resource management.\n84) On-demand workers are a developing part of the workforce. In a brief essay, explain what\non-demand workers are and how they impact organizations.\nAnswer: Today, in more and more companies like Uber, Elance, and Airbnb, employees aren't\nemployees at all. They are what are called on-demand workers, or freelancers and independent\ncontractors who work when they can on what they want to work on when the company needs\nthem. So, for example, Airbnb can run, in essence, a vast lodging company with only a fraction\nof the \"regular\" employees Hilton Worldwide or another hotel chain would need, as the lodgings\nare managed by the homeowners themselves. Other sites tapping on-demand workers include\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk, Elance-oDesk, TaskRabbit, and Handybook (which lets users tap\nHandy's thousands of freelance cleaners and furniture assemblers when they need jobs done).\nThese short-term professionals can be viewed as \"mobile, independent bundles of skills.\"\nEmployers' increasing reliance on such Uber-like \"extended workforces\" has implications for\nHR. Companies that rely on freelancers, consultants, and other such nontraditional employees\nwill need to create personnel policies on matters like compensation for these \"nonemployees\"\nand become more expert as talent brokers in matching specific workers with specific tasks that\nneed to be done.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 1\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Application of Knowledge\nLearning Outcome: 1.2 Briefly discuss and illustrate each of the important trends influencing\nhuman resource management.\n36\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n85) How has increasing globalization affected business?\nAnswer: Globalization has impacted how and where companies do business. Free trade areas—\nagreements that reduce tariffs and barriers among trading partners—encourage international\ntrade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) are\nexamples. Globalization has boomed for the past 50 or so years. For example, the total sum of\nU.S. imports and exports rose from $47 billion in 1960, to $562 billion in 1980, to about $5.1\ntrillion recently. Changing economic and political philosophies drove this boom. Governments\ndropped cross-border taxes or tariffs, formed economic free trade areas, and took other steps to\nencourage the free flow of trade among countries. The fundamental economic rationale was that\nby doing so, all countries would gain, and indeed, economies around the world did grow quickly\nuntil recently. At the same time, globalization vastly increased international competition. More\nglobalization meant more competition, and more competition meant more pressure to be \"world\nclass\"—to lower costs, to make employees more productive, and to do things better and less\nexpensively. As multinational companies jockey for position, many transfer operations abroad,\nnot just to seek cheaper labor but to tap into new markets. For example, Toyota has thousands of\nsales employees based in America, while GE has over 10,000 employees in France. The search\nfor greater efficiencies prompts some employers to offshore (export jobs to lower-cost locations\nabroad, as when Dell offshored some call-center jobs to India). Some employers offshore even\nhighly skilled jobs such as lawyer. Managing the \"people\" aspects of globalization is a big task\nfor any company that expands abroad—and for its HR managers.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 1\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Application of Knowledge\nLearning Outcome: 1.2 Briefly discuss and illustrate each of the important trends influencing\nhuman resource management.\n86) ________ involves formulating and executing human resource policies and practices that\nproduce the employee competencies and behaviors the company needs to achieve its strategic\naims.",
