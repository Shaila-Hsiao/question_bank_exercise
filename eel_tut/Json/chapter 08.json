After a training program has been\nestablished, how can managers make the training material more meaningful for employees?\nAnswer: Training programs consist of four steps. In the first, needs analysis step, you identify\nthe specific knowledge and skills the job requires, and compare these with the prospective\ntrainees' knowledge and skills. In the second, instructional design step, you formulate specific,\nmeasurable knowledge and performance training objectives, review possible training program\ncontent (including workbooks, exercises, and activities), and estimate a budget for the training\nprogram. The third step is to implement the program, by actually training the targeted employee\ngroup using methods such as on-the-job or online training. Finally, in an evaluation step, you\nassess the program's success. There are five suggestions for making training material more\nmeaningful for employees. First, an overall picture of the training material that will be presented\nshould be provided at the start of training. Second, familiar examples should be used. Third, the\ninformation should be logically organized and presented. Fourth, the vocabulary used during\ntraining should be familiar to the trainees. Fifth, many visual aids should be used.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.3 List and briefly explain each of the steps in the training process.\n14\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n35) What is the difference between a task analysis and a performance analysis? What is the\npurpose of each in regards to training?\nAnswer: Task analysis is a detailed study of the job to determine what specific skillsâlike Java\n(in the case of a Web developer) or interviewing (in the case of a supervisor)âthe job requires.\nJob descriptions and job specifications are important here. These list the job's specific duties and\nskills, which are the basic reference points in determining the training required. For under-\nperforming current employees, you can't assume that training is the problem: Is it lack of\ntraining, or something else? Performance analysis is the process of verifying that there is a\nperformance deficiency and determining whether the employer should correct such deficiencies\nthrough training or some other means (like transferring the employee). The first step in\nperformance analysis is usually to compare the person's actual performance to what it should be.\nDoing so helps to confirm that there is a performance deficiency and may also help the manager\nto identify its cause.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.3 List and briefly explain each of the steps in the training process.\n36) Tyler, a new accounts representative at Martin Marketing, is learning the job by actually\ndoing job-related tasks such as contacting customers.

What types of on-the-job training methods are most frequently\nused by employers?\nAnswer: On-the-job training (OJT) means having a person learn a job by actually doing it.\nEvery employee, from mailroom clerk to CEO, gets on-the-job training when he or she joins a\nfirm. In many firms, OJT is the only training available. The types of on-the-job training include\nthe coaching or understudy method, the job rotation method, and the special assignments\nmethod. Using the understudy method, an experienced worker or the trainee's supervisor trains\nthe employee. At lower levels, the trainee might observe the supervisor, but it is also used at\nhigher levels. Job rotation means that an employee moves from job to job at planned intervals.\nThis is common in management training programs.

For example, employers use CBT to teach employees\nsafe methods for avoiding falls. The system lets trainees replay the lessons and answer questions,\nand is especially effective when paired with actual practice under a trainer's watchful eye.\nComputer-based training is increasingly realistic. For example, interactive multimedia training\nintegrates the use of text, video, graphics, photos, animation, and sound to create a complex\ntraining environment with which the trainee interacts. In training a physician, for instance, such a\nsystem lets a medical student take a hypothetical patient's medical history, conduct an\nexamination, and analyze lab tests. The student can then interpret the sounds and draw\nconclusions for a diagnosis. Virtual reality training takes this realism a step further, by putting\ntrainees into a simulated environment.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.4 Explain how to use five training techniques.\n33\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n79) What is programmed learning and why is it used in organizations?\nAnswer: Programmed learning is a step-by-step self-learning method using a medium such as a\ntextbook, computer, or the Internet. The three parts of the method include presenting questions,\nfacts, and problems to the learner, allowing the person to respond, and then providing feedback\non the accuracy of answers. Programmed learning reduces training time. It also facilitates\nlearning by letting trainees learn at their own pace, get immediate feedback, and reduce their risk\nof error. Some argue that trainees do not learn much more from programmed learning than from\na textbook. Yet studies generally support programmed learning's effectiveness. In addition to the\nusual programmed learning, computerized intelligent tutoring systems learn what questions and\napproaches worked and did not work for the learner, and then adjust the instructional sequence to\nthe trainee's unique needs.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.4 Explain how to use five training techniques.\n80) Any attempt to improve managerial performance by imparting knowledge, changing\nattitudes, or increasing skills is called ________.",

The manager may accomplish this through organizational development techniques.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n40\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n96) During the refreezing stage of Lewin's change process, managers are likely to use new\nappraisal systems and incentives as a way to reinforce desired behaviors.\nAnswer: TRUE\nExplanation: During the refreezing stage, managers reinforce the new ways of doing things with\nchanges to the company's systems and procedures. This is done by using new appraisal systems\nand incentives to reinforce the desired behaviors.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n97) During the unfreezing stage of organizational change, managers need to establish a sense of\nurgency, which may be accomplished by providing employees with reports indicating that the\nfirm faces significant problems.\nAnswer: TRUE\nExplanation: Most managers start by creating a sense of urgency during the unfreezing stage.\nThis often takes creativity. For example, the CEO might present executives with a (fictitious)\nanalyst's report describing the firm's imminent demise.\nDifficulty: Easy\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n98) The human process category of organizational development includes T-groups, process\nconsultation, and third-party intervention.\nAnswer: TRUE\nExplanation: The human process category of OD includes T-groups, process consultation, third-\nparty intervention, team building, organizational confrontation meetings, and survey research.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n41\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n99) Organizational development is usually characterized by the use of action research and the\napplication of behavioral science knowledge.\nAnswer: TRUE\nExplanation: OD usually involves action research, which means collecting data about a group,\ndepartment, or organization, and feeding the information back to the employees so they can\nanalyze it and develop hypotheses about what the problems in the unit might be. OD also\ninvolves the application of behavioral science knowledge to improve the organization's\neffectiveness.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n100) Organizational development interventions in the area of human resource management most\nlikely involve changing a firm's formal structure.\nAnswer: FALSE\nExplanation: OD practitioners make technostructural interventions when they get involved in\nchanging firms' structures, methods, and job designs. For example, in a formal structural change\nprogram, the employees collect data on the company's existing organizational structure; they\nthen jointly redesign and implement a new one.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n101) Survey research and team building are technostructural organizational development\ntechniques.\nAnswer: FALSE\nExplanation: Survey research, team building, and T-groups are OD techniques related to the\nhuman process rather than technostructural issues.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 5\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n42\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n102) In a brief essay, discuss the theory behind Kurt Lewin's model of change. According to\nLewin, what is the process that should be followed to implement organizational change?\nAnswer: According to Lewin, all behavior in organizations is a product of two kinds of forcesâ\nthose striving to maintain the status quo and those pushing for change. Implementing change\nmeans either weakening the status quo forces or building up the forces for change. Lewin's\nchange process consists of three steps: 1) unfreezing the forces that seek to maintain the status\nquo, 2) moving to develop new behaviors and attitudes, and 3) refreezing the organization into\nits new system to prevent it from reverting to its old ways.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n103) What is meant by the idea of organizational change? How does organizational development\nfacilitate organizational change?\nAnswer: Managers can change one or more of five aspects of their companiesâtheir strategy,\nculture, structure, technologies, or the attitudes and skills of the employees. Organizational\nchange often begins with a change in the firm's strategy, mission, and visionâwith strategic\nchange. However, strategic, cultural, structural, and technological changes will fail without the\nemployees' active support. Organizational change therefore invariably involves bringing about\nchanges in the employees themselves and in their attitudes, skills, and behaviors. Unfortunately,\ngetting that active support (or at least silent compliance) from your employees is easier said than\ndone. The manager invariably runs into employee resistance. Knowing how to deal with that\nresistance is the heart of implementing an organizational change program. Organizational\ndevelopment is a change process through which employees formulate the change that's required\nand implement it, often with the assistance of trained consultants.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 8\nObjective: 6\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 8.6 List and briefly discuss the importance of the steps in leading\norganizational change.\n43\nCopyright Â© 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n104) Which of the following is most likely NOT measured when evaluating a training program?",

        "explanation": "C) There are several things firms can measure to evaluate a training program, such\nas the participants' reactions to the program, what (if anything) the trainees learned from the\nprogram, and to what extent their on-the-job behavior or results changed as a result of the\nprogram. It would be difficult to link overall organizational productivity to a training program."
