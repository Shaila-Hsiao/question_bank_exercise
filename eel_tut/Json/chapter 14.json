How does it related to performance appraisal?\nAnswer: Fairness is inseparable from what most people think of as \"justice.\" A company that is\njust is, among other things, equitable, fair, impartial, and unbiased in how it does things. With\nrespect to employee relations, experts generally define organizational justice in terms of at least\ntwo components—distributive justice and procedural justice. Distributive justice refers to the\nfairness and justice of the decision's result. Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the process.\nHow you conduct appraisals is important in regards to fairness and organizational justice. Studies\nconfirm that, in practice, some managers ignore accuracy in performance appraisals and instead\nuse the process for political purposes. Few things can send a more damaging signal about how\nfair and ethical the company is. To send the signal that organizational justice exists, standards\nshould be clear, employees should understand the basis upon which you're going to appraise\nthem, the appraisal itself should be objective, and the employer should include ethics goals in\nappraisals of its leaders, particularly its senior leaders.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.2 Discuss at least four methods for managing employee relations.\n15\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n44) Discuss at least 2 different types of employee involvement teams. Define each type and when\nan organization might use them.\nAnswer: Employers also use special teams to gain employees' involvement.\nSuggestion teams are temporary teams whose members work on specific analytical assignments,\nsuch as how to cut costs or raise productivity. One airline split employees (such as baggage\nhandlers and ground crew) into separate teams, linking team members via its Web site for\nbrainstorming and voting on ideas.\nSome employers go beyond suggestions teams and create problem-solving teams which\nformalize this process and make the teams semipermanent. These identify and research work\nprocesses and develop solutions to work-related problems. They usually consist of the supervisor\nand five to eight employees from a common work area.\nA quality circle is a type of formal problem-solving team, usually composed of 6 to 12 specially\ntrained employees who meet weekly to solve problems affecting their work area. The team gets\ntraining in problem-analysis techniques (including basic statistics). Then it applies these\ntechniques to solve problems in its work area.\nThe last type is self-managing/self-directed work teams which are small (usually 8 to 10\nmembers) groups of carefully selected, trained, and empowered employees who basically run\nthemselves with little or no outside supervision, usually for the purpose of accomplishing a\nspecific task or mission. The task or mission might be an auto dashboard installed or a fully\nprocessed insurance claim, but the main characteristic is that the one team is created to do the\ntask and has significant autonomy in how they do so.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.2 Discuss at least four methods for managing employee relations.\n16\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n45) What are the main characteristics of workplace bullying? How can employers and their HR\ndepartments reduce bullying incidents in the workplace?\nAnswer: Bullying—singling out someone to harass and mistreat them—is an increasingly\nserious problem. While definitions of bullying vary, most would agree that bullying involves\nthree things:\n• Imbalance of Power: people who bully use their power to control or harm and the people\nbeing bullied may have a hard time defending themselves,\n• Intent to Cause Harm: actions done by accident are not bullying; the person bullying has a\ngoal to cause harm,\n• Repetition: incidents of bullying happen to the same person over and over by the same person\nor group.\nEmployers and HR departments must have systems in place to ensure that the company can\nidentify unfair treatment and deal with it expeditiously. This includes having policies in place to\nmonitor employees' use of social media Web sites, developing ethics codes, and establishing an\norganizational culture that does not tolerate bullying.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.2 Discuss at least four methods for managing employee relations.\n46) The principles of conduct governing an individual or a group are referred to as ________.",

How does an employee's morality relate to making ethical decisions in the\nworkplace?\nAnswer: Making ethical decisions are rooted in morality. Morality is society's highest accepted\nstandards of behavior. Moral standards guide behaviors of the most serious consequence to\nsociety's well-being, such as murder, lying, and slander. Authoritative bodies like legislatures\ncan't change what morality means. Moral judgments also trigger strong emotions. Violating\nmoral standards may therefore make someone feel ashamed or remorseful. The most powerful\nmorality comes from within. Because people bring to their jobs their own ideas of what is\nmorally right and wrong, the individual must shoulder much of the credit (or blame) for ethical\nchoices. Research indicates that for CEOs, personal inclinations more strongly affect decisions\nthan do environmental pressures or organizational characteristics.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Ethical Understanding and Reasoning\nLearning Outcome: 14.3 Explain what is meant by ethical behavior.\n85) What is organizational culture? How can managers influence the ethical nature of a firm's\nculture?\nAnswer: Organizational culture is the characteristic values, traditions, and behaviors a\ncompany's employees share. A value is a basic belief about what is right or wrong, or about what\nyou should or shouldn't do. Values are important because they guide and channel behavior.\nManaging people and shaping their behavior therefore depends on shaping the values they use as\nbehavioral guides. The firm's culture should therefore send clear signals about what is and isn't\nacceptable behavior. Managers can take several steps, including clarifying expectations with\nrespect to values, providing physical support to reward ethical behavior, and walking the talk by\nsetting a good example of expected behavior.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.3 Explain what is meant by ethical behavior.\n86) What is the \"Bad Apples, Bad Cases, and Bad Barrels\" way of looking at ethics in\norganizations? Describe each category.\nAnswer: One review of over 30 years of ethics research concluded that three factors combine to\ndetermine the ethical choices we make. The authors titled their paper \"Bad Apples, Bad Cases,\nand Bad Barrels.\" This title highlighted their conclusion that when \"Bad apples\" (people who are\ninclined to make unethical choices), must deal with \"Bad cases\" (ethical situations that are ripe\nfor unethical choices), while working in \"Bad barrels\" (company environments that foster or\ncondone unethical choices) then people tend to act unethically.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.3 Explain what is meant by ethical behavior.\n32\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n87) What can you do as an HR manager to ensure that you hire ethical employees?\nAnswer: Employers can start before the applicant even applies by creating recruitment materials\nthat emphasize ethics.

The \"business purpose exception\" permits\nemployers to monitor communications if they can show a legitimate business reason for doing\nso. The second, \"consent exception,\" lets employers monitor communications if they have their\nemployees' consent to do so.

Describe the 3 pillars of a fair\nprocess.\nAnswer: The three pillars for ensuring that the disciplinary process is fair are establishing clear\nrules and regulations, a system of progressive penalties, and an appeals process.\nRULES AND REGULATIONS: An acceptable disciplinary process begins with a set of clear\ndisciplinary rules and regulations. The rules should cover problems such as theft, destruction of\ncompany property, drinking on the job, and insubordination.\nPENALTIES A system of progressive penalties is the second pillar of effective discipline. The\nseverity of the penalty usually depends on the offense and the number of times it has occurred.\nFor example, most companies issue warnings for the first unexcused lateness. However, for a\nfourth offense, discharge is the usual disciplinary action.\nAPPEALS PROCESS: An appeals process should be part of the disciplinary process. The aim\nhere is to ensure that supervisors mete out discipline fairly. If a decision is unfair the\norganizations wants the employee to have an opportunity to have the decision reviewed and\npotentially overruled.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 14.4 Explain what is meant by fair disciplinary practices.\n40\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n107) What is nonpunitive discipline? What are the steps of the nonpunitive discipline process? If\nyou were a manager, would you use a system of traditional discipline or nonpunitive discipline?\nWhy?\nAnswer: Nonpunitive discipline refers to the use of discipline without punishment. In lieu of\ntraditional punishment, employees who have disobeyed corporate rules are disciplined using the\nfollowing system. First, an oral reminder of the rules in question is issued. If another infraction\noccurs within six weeks of the first, a formal written reminder is issued and a copy of the\nreminder is placed in the employee's personnel file. A private discussion is also held with the\nemployee but without any threats. If a third incident occurs, the employee is given a one-day\nleave with pay to consider whether this job is a good fit for him or her and whether he or she will\ncommit to meeting the company's policies. The following day, the employee meets with his or\nher supervisor to discuss his or her decision to stay and follow the rules or leave. If no further\nincidents occur, the suspension information is purged from the employee's file. If the behavior is\nrepeated, the next step is dismissal.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 14\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Application of Knowledge\nLearning Outcome: 14.4 Explain what is meant by fair disciplinary practices.\n41\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n108) Health-Tech Materials is a firm that manufactures medical equipment purchased by\nhospitals and clinics.
