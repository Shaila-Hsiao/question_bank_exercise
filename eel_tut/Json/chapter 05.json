Provide your answer in a brief\nessay.\nAnswer: Trend tools used for projecting personnel needs include the trend analysis, the ratio\nanalysis, and scatter plot. Trend analysis means studying variations in your firm's employment\nlevels over the last few years. Trend analysis can provide an initial estimate of future staffing\nneeds, but employment levels rarely depend just on the passage of time. Other factors (like\nchanges in sales volume and productivity) also affect staffing needs. Another simple approach,\nratio analysis, means making forecasts based on the historical ratio between (1) some causal\nfactor (like sales volume) and (2) the number of employees required (such as number of\nsalespeople). Also, a scatter plot shows graphically how two variables—such as sales and your\nfirm's staffing levels—are related.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 5\nObjective: 1\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 5.1 Explain the main techniques used in employment planning and\nforecasting.\n37) What methods are used by both small and large firms to forecast the supply of inside\ncandidates?\nAnswer: Department managers or owners of smaller firms often use manual devices to track\nemployee qualifications. Thus a qualification (or skill) inventory contains data on employees'\nperformance records, educational background, and promotability. Thus personnel inventory and\ndevelopment records compile qualification information on each employee. Personnel\nreplacement charts are another option, particularly for the firm's top positions. They show the\npresent performance and promotability for each position's potential replacement. Larger firms\nobviously can't track the qualifications of hundreds or thousands of employees manually. Larger\nemployers therefore computerize this information, using various packaged software systems.\nIncreasingly, they also link skills inventories with their other human resources systems. So, for\ninstance, an employee's skills inventory might automatically update each time he is trained or\nappraised.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 5\nObjective: 1\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 5.1 Explain the main techniques used in employment planning and\nforecasting.\n17\n\n\n38) Bob needs to find and attract applicants to his company's open positions, which is known as\n________.",

First, there is\nreally no substitute for knowing a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, as you should after\nworking with them for some time. Current employees may also be more committed to the\ncompany. Morale may rise if employees see promotions as rewards for loyalty and competency.\nAnd inside candidates should require less orientation and (perhaps) training than outsiders.\nHowever, hiring from within can also backfire.

When all managers come up through the ranks, they may have a tendency\nto maintain the status quo when a new direction is required. Internet recruiting is a cost-effective\nway to publicize openings; it generates more responses quicker and for a longer time at less cost\nthan just about any other method.

An HR manager must attract attention to the ad with phrases and words that grab\nthe attention of readers. Next, a manager needs to develop interest in the job. You can create\ninterest with lines such as, \"Are you looking to make an impact?\" or use other aspects of the job,\nsuch as its location. Create desire by spotlighting words such as travel or challenge. As an\nexample, having a graduate school nearby may appeal to engineers and professional people.\nFinally, the ad should prompt action with a statement like \"Call today.\" In general, more\ninformation is better than less.

Provide\nat least four reasons for the use of such employment agencies.\nAnswer: There are many reasons for using a private employment agency. The firm does not\nhave to have internal human resource specialists for recruiting and screening. The firm may need\nthe position filled very quickly. There is a perceived need to recruit more minority and female\napplicants. When the best candidates are employed elsewhere, it is more comfortable to have an\nagency approach the candidates.

Time sheets should be used because they provide a verification of hours\nworked and an agreement to pay the agency's fees. The company should find out what policies\nguide the hiring of an agency temp as a permanent employee. The company should also find out\nhow the agency recruits employees and what kind of benefits it pays. The company should\nspecify its dress code at each location to the agency. The company should insist on getting a\ndocument from the agency stating that it is not discriminating when filling temp orders. Finally,\nmake sure that the agency has the proper information regarding what is required to adequately\nfill each job position.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 5\nObjective: 5\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 5.5 List and discuss the main outside sources of candidates.\n40\n\n\n96) What are the differences between the two types of executive recruiters? How do firms\nbenefit from using executive recruiters?\nAnswer: Executive recruiters may be contingent or retained. Retained recruiters are paid\nwhether or not the employer eventually hires the executive through the efforts of the search firm.\nThese recruiters tend to focus on executive positions paying $150,000 or more. Contingency-\nbased recruiters tend to handle junior to middle level management job searches in the $50,000-\n$150,000 range. Recruiters bring a lot to the table. They have many contacts and are especially\nadept at finding qualified employed candidates who aren't actively looking to change jobs. They\ncan keep your firm's name confidential until late into the search process. The recruiter can save\ntop management's time by finding and screening an applicant pool. The recruiter's fee might\nactually turn out to be small when you compare it to the executive time saved.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 5\nObjective: 5\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 5.5 List and discuss the main outside sources of candidates.\n97) Why is effective recruiting a challenge for many employers? What methods can employers\nuse to effectively recruit a more diverse workforce?\nAnswer: Effective recruiting is difficult for many employers because some recruiting methods\nare superior to others, depending on the type of job for which you are recruiting. Second, the\nsuccess you have recruiting depends greatly on nonrecruitment issues and policies. For example,\npaying 10% more than most firms in your locale should, other things being equal, help you build\na bigger applicant pool faster. Third, employment law prescribes what you can and cannot do\nwhen recruiting. For example, managers can't rely on word-of-mouth dissemination of\ninformation about job opportunities when the workforce is substantially all white or all members\nof some other class, such as Hispanic. In order for businesses to effectively recruit a more\ndiverse workforce, they should take the goal of recruiting more minorities seriously, and pursue\nthat goal energetically. In practice, this requires a three-part effort: Understand the recruitment\nbarriers that prevent minorities from applying, formulate the required recruitment plans for\nattracting and retaining minorities and women, and institute the specific day-to-day programs\ninto recruitment programs.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 5\nObjective: 5\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 5.5 List and discuss the main outside sources of candidates.\n41\n\n\n98) The fastest growing labor force segment in the United States over the next few years will be\nthose from ________ years old.",

Since fewer older people use the Internet, online application\ngathering may inadvertently exclude disproportionate numbers of older applicants and certain\nminorities. To prove they've complied with EEO laws, employers should keep track of each\napplicant's race, sex, and ethnic group. The EEO says that, to be an \"applicant,\" he or she must\nmeet three conditions: he or she must express interest in employment; the employer must have\ntaken steps to fill a specific job; and the individual must have followed the employer's standard\napplication procedure. Firms must adhere to EEO laws in regards to the information they request\non job application forms. For example, firms should remember that questions about an\napplicant's education should avoid asking about the dates of attendance and graduation from\nvarious schools because the information may reflect the applicant's age. The courts have usually\nheld that employers violate Title VII by disqualifying applicants from employment because of an\narrest, so forms should not ask about an applicant's arrest record. Some forms ask the applicant\nto list memberships in clubs, organizations, or societies. Employers should include instructions\nnot to include organizations that would reveal race, religion, physical handicaps, marital status,\nor ancestry.
