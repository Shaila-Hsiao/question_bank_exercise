Competency-based appraisals\nfocus on the extent to which the employee exhibits the competencies that the employer values.\nThe employer could also appraise the employee based on the extent to which he or she is\nachieving his or her objectives.

How would a manager develop a\nBARS?\nAnswer: A behaviorally anchored rating scale is a rating scale that is anchored with specific\nbehavioral examples of good or poor performance. Because of the anchors, which are based on\nthe dimensions of performance illustrated by critical incidents, a BARS combines the benefits of\nnarratives, critical incident, and quantified scales. There are five steps required for developing a\nBARS. Each step is explained below.\n• Step 1: Write critical incidents. In this step, people who know the job are asked to describe\nspecific illustrations of effective and ineffective performance.\n• Step 2: Develop performance dimensions. The people who know the job are then asked to\ncluster the incidents into a smaller set of performance dimensions and to define each dimension\nwith a name.\n• Step 3: Reallocate incidents. Another group of people, who also know the job, should reallocate\nthe original critical incidents. They will receive the cluster definitions and the list of critical\nincidents. They will then reassign each incident into the cluster they think it fits best. If the\nassignments made by the first group and second group match well, then that critical incident is\nretained.\n• Step 4: Scale the incidents. The second group then rates the behavior described by the incident\nas to how effectively or ineffectively it represents performance on the dimension.\n• Step 5: Develop a final instrument. Six or seven of the incidents are the dimension's behavioral\nanchors.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 9\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 9.2 Discuss the pros and cons of at least eight performance appraisal\nmethods.\n71) Graphic rating scales are subject to all of the following problems EXCEPT ________.",

How can rating committees improve the fairness\nof the appraisal process?\nAnswer: The first technique is to learn and understand the potential problem and possible\nsolutions. Simply understanding the potential for the problem can help to avoid it. Second, using\nthe right appraisal tool for each situation is important. Third, supervisors can keep a diary of\ncritical incidents to file and use for later reference for subordinate's appraisals. This technique\nhelps to ensure that both negative and positive incidents are recorded. Fourth, make sure that the\nprimary goal of the appraisal is to improve unsatisfactory performance or reinforce exemplary\nperformance. Finally, the appraisal should be fair. Many employers use rating committees. These\ncommittees usually contain the employee's immediate supervisor and two or three other\nsupervisors. Using multiple raters makes sense.

How can a\nmanager handle a subordinate who is defensive when told that his or her performance is poor?\nAnswer: There are four reasons for conducting performance appraisals. First, most employers\nbase pay, promotion, retention decision on the employee's appraisal. Second, appraisals play a\ncentral role in the employer's performance management process. Third, it lets the manager and\nsubordinate develop a plan for correcting any deficiencies that might exist and to reinforce and\nsupport things that are done well. Fourth, appraisals can serve a useful career planning purpose\nby providing the opportunity to review the employee's career plans in light of his or her strengths\nand weaknesses. When a supervisor tells someone his or her performance is poor, the first\nreaction is often denial. Denial is a defense mechanism. Understanding and dealing with\ndefensiveness is an important appraisal skill. A supervisor should recognize that defensive\nbehavior is normal and never attack a person's defenses.
