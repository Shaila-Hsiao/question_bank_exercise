Later, job performance measures are compared to the test scores under\ndevelopment.\nAnswer: TRUE\nExplanation: Predictive validation is the second and more dependable way to validate a test.\nHere you administer the test to applicants before you hire them. Then hire these applicants using\nonly existing selection techniques, not the results of the new tests.

What\nrights do test takers have during the testing process?\nAnswer: Once you review your applicants' résumés, the next step is selecting the best candidates\nfor the job, which is where testing and other screening tools become important. Employers\nnarrow the applicant pool by using the screening tools such as tests, assessment centers, and\nbackground and reference checks. Then the supervisor can interview likely candidates and\ndecide who to hire. Nothing you do at work is more important than hiring the right employees. It\nis important for three main reasons: performance, costs, and legal obligations. Test takers have\nrights to privacy and feedback under the American Psychological Association's (APA) standard\nfor educational and psychological tests; these guide psychologists but are not legally enforceable.\nTest takers have the right to the confidentiality of test results, the right to informed consent\nregarding use of these results, the right to expect that only people qualified to interpret the scores\nwill have access to them, or that sufficient information will accompany the scores to ensure their\nappropriate interpretation and the right to expect the test is fair to all. For example, no one taking\nit should have prior access to the questions or answers.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.2 Explain what is meant by reliability and validity.\n17\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n45) What is test validity? How are selection tests validated?\nAnswer: Test validity answers the question \"Does this test measure what it's supposed to\nmeasure?\" Put another way, validity refers to the correctness of the inferences that we can make\nbased on the test. With employee selection tests, validity often refers to evidence that the test is\njob related—in other words, that performance on the test is a valid predictor of job performance.\nSelection tests are validated by a five step process: analyze the job, choose the tests, administer\nthe test, relate test scores to criteria, and revalidate the test.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.2 Explain what is meant by reliability and validity.\n46) What is the difference between criterion validity and content validity? Which one is more\ndifficult to demonstrate?\nAnswer: Criterion validity means demonstrating that those who do well on the test also do well\non the job and those that do poorly on the test do poorly on the job. Employers can demonstrate\ncontent validity of a test by showing that the test constitutes a fair sample of the content of the\njob. If the content on the test is representative of what the person needs to know for the job, then\nthe test is probably content valid. Demonstrating content validity sounds easier than it is in\npractice. Demonstrating that (1) the tasks the person performs on the test are really a\ncomprehensive and random sample of the tasks performed on the job and (2) the conditions\nunder which the person takes the test resemble the work situation is not always easy. For many\njobs, employers opt to demonstrate other evidence of a test's validity—most often, criterion\nvalidity.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.2 Explain what is meant by reliability and validity.\n18\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n47) For over 40 years, Golden Creamery has been mixing up fresh, gourmet ice cream for\ncustomers.

They should also help with the testing and\nscreening.\nDifficulty: Easy\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n73) In a brief essay, discuss the use and effectiveness of cognitive tests versus work sampling\ntechniques for employee selection.\nAnswer: Cognitive tests are tests of general intellectual abilities. They measure not a single trait\nbut rather a range of abilities, including memory, vocabulary, verbal fluency, and numerical\nability. Psychologists often call such tests aptitude tests, since they purport to measure aptitude\nfor the job in question. Consider the Test of Mechanical Comprehension which tests applicants'\nunderstanding of basic mechanical principles. This may reflect a person's aptitude for jobs—like\nthat of machinist or engineer—that require mechanical comprehension. The work sampling\ntechnique tries to predict job performance by requiring job candidates to perform one or more\nsamples of the job's basic tasks. Work sampling has several advantages. It measures actual job\ntasks, so it's harder to fake answers. The work sample's content—the actual tasks the person must\nperform— is not as likely to be unfair to minorities. Designed properly, work samples exhibit\nbetter validity than do other tests designed to predict performance.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n30\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n74) How would an employer benefit from using both personality tests and situational tests when\nscreening job applicants?\nAnswer: A person's cognitive and physical abilities alone seldom explain his or her job\nperformance. Other factors, like motivation and interpersonal skills, are very important, and\nthese can be discovered through personality tests. Employers use personality tests to measure and\npredict intangibles of an applicant's personality, such as introversion, stability, and motivation.\nSituational tests require examinees to respond to situations representative of the job. Work\nsampling, video-based tests, and miniature job training are situational tests. Miniature job\ntraining and evaluation assumes that a person who demonstrates that he or she can learn and\nperform the sample of tasks will be able to learn and perform the job itself. This approach tests\napplicants with actual samples of the job, so it's inherently content relevant and valid.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n75) Industrial psychologists often emphasize the \"big five\" personality dimensions in personnel\ntesting. List and explain the meaning of the big five dimensions. How do personality traits\ncorrelate with job performance?\nAnswer: The \"big five\" personality dimensions are neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness,\nconscientiousness, and openness to experience. Neuroticism refers to a tendency to exhibit poor\nemotional adjustment and experience negative effects like anxiety and insecurity. Extroversion\nrepresents a tendency to be sociable, assertive, and active. Openness to experience is the\ndisposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. Agreeableness\nis the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. Conscientiousness is comprised of\ntwo related facets including achievement and dependability.\nExtroversion is generally associated with success in sales. Extroversion, conscientiousness, and\nopenness to experience are strong predictors of leadership. Neuroticism is negatively related to\nmotivation. Conscientiousness is the most consistent and universal predictor of job performance.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n31\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n76) What is a management assessment center? What are some of the most common tasks\nconducted in management assessment centers?\nAnswer: A management assessment center is a 2-3 day simulation in which 10-12 candidates\nperform realistic management tasks under the observation of experts who appraise each\ncandidate's leadership potential. Typical simulated exercises include 1) the in basket, 2)\nleaderless group discussion, 3) management games, 4) individual presentations, 5) objective\ntests, and 6) the interview. These centers can be used for promotion and development purposes\nas well as for selection.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n77) What are three arguments against the use of personality tests as predictors of job\nperformance?\nAnswer: First, projective tests are hard to interpret. An expert must analyze the test taker's\ninterpretations and infer from them his or her personality. The test's usefulness then assumes\nthere's a measurable relationship between a personality trait (like introversion) and success on\nthe job. Second, personality tests can trigger legal challenges. For example, one court held that\nthe MMPI is a medical test (because it can screen out applicants with psychological\nimpairments), and so might violate the ADA. Third, some experts dispute that self-report\npersonality tests predict performance at all. Fourth, people can and will fake responses to\npersonality tests. So personality tests can be useful tools but there can be significant concerns\nabout use.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 6\nObjective: 3\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 6.3 List and briefly describe the basic categories of selection tests, with\nexamples.\n78) With the work sampling technique, applicants are ________.",
