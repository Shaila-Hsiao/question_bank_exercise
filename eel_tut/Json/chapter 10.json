This should include a demographic analysis\n(including a census of the company's employees), a determination of the average retirement age\nfor the company's employees, and a review of how retirement is going to affect the employer's\nhealth care and pension benefits.

A reasonable first step is to\nconduct numerical analyses of pending retirements. Employers seeking to recruit and/or retain\nretirees need to take several steps. The general idea is to institute human resource policies that\nencourage and support older workers. Other techniques employers use to keep older workers\ninclude offering them part-time positions, hiring them as consultants or temporary workers,\noffering them flexible work arrangements, encouraging them to work past traditional retirement\nage, providing training to upgrade skills, and instituting a phased retirement program.

First,\norganizations should take the career interests of women employees seriously. They should\nidentify institutional barriers and eliminate them. For instance, requiring late evening meetings\ndisproportionately affects women. Unfortunately, many career development programs are not\nconsistent with the needs of minority and nonminority women. For example, many such\nprograms underestimate the role played by family responsibilities in many women's lives.\nSimilarly, some programs assume that career paths are continuous; however, the need to stop\nworking for a time to attend to family needs often punctuates the career paths of many people of\ncolor and women. Inflexible promotional ladders (such as \"You must work 8 years of 50-hour\nweeks to apply for partner\") can put women—who often have more responsibility for child-\nraising chores—at a disadvantage. One solution is to institute career tracks (including reduced\nhours and more flexible year-round work schedules) that enable women to periodically reduce\ntheir time at work, but remain on a partner track. Companies should improve the opportunities\nfor networking and mentoring. They should eliminate the glass ceiling; though this is a difficult\nchallenge. Finally, companies can institute flexible schedules to provide women the opportunity\nto meet their obligations at home and at work successfully.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 10\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 10.4 List and briefly explain the main decisions employers should address in\nreaching promotion and other employee life-cycle career decisions.\n98) In a brief essay, discuss the four decisions that affect a firm's promotion process.\nAnswer: The first decision is whether to base promotions on seniority or competency or some\ncombination of the two. A focus on competitiveness and motivation favors promotion based on\ncompetency. But when union or civil service regulations are involved, seniority may be favored.\nThe second decision occurs if the firm chooses to base the promotional process on competency.\nIf it does, the firm must then decide how to define and measure competency. Past performance is\nbased on defining the job, setting standards, and appraising performance. For promotional\npurposes, the organization must decide whether this past performance is also predictive of a\ncandidate's future performance. The third decision is whether the process is formal or informal. If\nthe process is informal, employees may feel like one's personal network is more important than\nperformance. Formal procedures include formal promotion policies that are distributed to all\nemployees. They may also include a job-posting policy and the use of employee qualification\nbriefs. The fourth decision is whether the promotion will be vertical or horizontal or something\nelse. This may be an issue if a company is downsizing. Promotions can involve different types of\npositions aside from supervisory positions.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 10\nObjective: 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 10.4 List and briefly explain the main decisions employers should address in\nreaching promotion and other employee life-cycle career decisions.\n42\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n99) ________ is reducing, usually dramatically, the number of people employed by a firm.",
