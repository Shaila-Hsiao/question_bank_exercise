Briefly describe one\nof the methods commonly used for gathering job analysis data.\nAnswer: Job analysis provides information for recruitment and selection by laying out what the\njob entails and what human characteristics are required to perform these activities. This\ninformation helps management decide what sort of people to recruit and hire. Job analysis\ninformation is also crucial for estimating the value of each job and its appropriate compensation.\nA performance appraisal compares each employee's actual performance with his or her\nperformance standards. Managers use job analysis to determine the job's specific activities and\nperformance standards.\nJob analysis interviews are one of the most commonly used methods for gathering job analysis\ndata. They range from completely unstructured interviews to highly structured ones containing\nhundreds of specific items to check off. Managers may conduct individual interviews with each\nemployee, group interviews with groups of employees who have the same job, and/or supervisor\ninterviews with one or more supervisors who know the job.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 4\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 4.2 Discuss the process of job analysis, including why it is important.\n17\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n44) What are the steps involved in the job analysis process? Briefly discuss the methods\navailable for collecting job analysis information.\nAnswer: There are six steps in doing a job analysis. Step 1: Decide How You Will Use the\nInformation. Step 2: Review Relevant Background Information about the Job, Such as\nOrganization Charts and Process Charts. Step 3: Select Representative Positions.\nStep 4: Actually Analyze the Job. Step 5: Verify the Job Analysis Information with the\nWorker Performing the Job and with His or Her Immediate Supervisor.

In practice, you could use any one of them, or\ncombine several. The basic rule is to use those that best fit your purpose. Thus, an interview\nmight be best for creating a list of job duties and job descriptions. The more quantitative position\nanalysis questionnaire may be best for quantifying each job's relative worth for pay purposes.\nInterviews, questionnaires, observations, and diary/logs are the most popular methods for\ngathering job analysis data.

Thus, the\nworker who previously only bolted the seat to the legs might attach the back as well. Job rotation\nmeans systematically moving workers from one job to another. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg\nargued that the best way to motivate workers is through job enrichment. Job enrichment means\nredesigning jobs in a way that increases the opportunities for the worker to experience feelings of\nresponsibility, achievement, growth, and recognition. It does this by empowering the worker—\nfor instance, by giving the worker the skills and authority to inspect the work, instead of having\nsupervisors do that.

Explain your answer in a brief essay.\nAnswer: Job analysis can be a time-consuming process. Managers can save time by holding\ngroup interviews with groups of employees who have the same job. Managers use group\ninterviews when a large number of employees are performing similar or identical work, since\nthis can be a quick and inexpensive way to gather information.

You use this information to write a job\nspecification; this lists the knowledge, abilities, and skills required to perform the job\nsatisfactorily. There is no standard format for writing a job description. However, most\ndescriptions contain sections that cover:\n1. Job identification\n2. Job summary\n3. Responsibilities and duties\n4. Authority of incumbent\n5. Standards of performance\n6. Working conditions\n7. Job specifications\nThe job specification takes the job description and answers the question, \"What human traits and\nexperience are required to do this job effectively?\" It shows what kind of person to recruit and\nfor what qualities you should test that person. The job specification may be a section of the job\ndescription, or a separate document.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 4\nObjective: 4, 5\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 4.5 Explain how to write a job specification.\n42\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n99) A human resource manager needs to develop job specifications for a new position at her\nfirm. She can either base the job specifications on statistical analysis or on common sense.\nBriefly describe each method, and recommend which method the HR manager should use.\nAnswer: Most job specifications come from the educated guesses of people like supervisors and\nhuman resource managers. The basic procedure here is to ask, \"What does it take in terms of\neducation, intelligence, training, and the like to do this job well?\" There are several ways to get\nthese \"educated guesses.\" You could simply review the job's duties and deduce from those what\nhuman traits and skills the job requires. You can also choose them from the competencies listed\nin Web-based job descriptions. In any case, use common sense when compiling your list. Don't\nignore the behaviors that may apply to almost any job but that might not normally surface\nthrough a job analysis. Industriousness is an example. Who wants an employee who doesn't work\nhard?\nThe other option is to base job specifications on statistical analysis, which is more defensible but\nalso more difficult. The aim here is to determine statistically the relationship between (1) some\npredictor (human trait, such as height, intelligence, or finger dexterity), and (2) some indicator or\ncriterion of job effectiveness, such as performance as rated by the supervisor. The procedure has\nfive steps: (1) analyze the job and decide how to measure job performance; (2) select personal\ntraits like finger dexterity that you believe should predict successful performance; (3) test\ncandidates for these traits; (4) measure these candidates' subsequent job performance; and (5)\nstatistically analyze the relationship between the human trait (finger dexterity) and job\nperformance. Your objective is to determine whether the former predicts the latter. This method\nis more defensible than the judgmental approach because equal rights legislation forbids using\ntraits that you can't prove distinguish between high and low job performers.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 4\nObjective: 5\nAACSB: Application of Knowledge\nLearning Outcome: 4.5 Explain how to write a job specification.\n100) Which of the following describes a job in terms of measurable and observable behaviors\nthat an employee must exhibit to do the job well?",
        "options": {
            "A": "competency-based job analysis",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A) A competency-based job analysis refers to describing a job in terms of\nmeasurable, observable, behavioral competencies that an employee doing the job must exhibit to\ndo the job well. This method contrasts with traditional job analysis that describes jobs in terms of\njob duties and responsibilities. Competency-based analysis is worker-focused."

        "options": {
            "A": "What are the typical duties associated with this job?",
            "B": "What are the working conditions and safety issues related to this job?",

        },
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D) The focus of a competency-based job analysis is the skills of the worker rather\nthan the duties, equipment, or working conditions of the job. Traditional job-analysis is more\njob-focused while competency-based analysis is more worker-focused."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C) Competency-based job descriptions are more appropriate than traditional job\ndescriptions when high-performance work systems are the goal. In a HPWS, workers are\nencouraged to serve as team members and to rotate freely among jobs, so competencies should\nbe the focus rather than a list of specific job duties which might hinder employee flexibility."
