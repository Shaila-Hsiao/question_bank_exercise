How does\ncompensation for managers or professionals differ from compensation for clerical or production\nworkers at a firm?\nAnswer: There are two basic ways to make direct financial payments to employees: base them\non increments of time or on performance. Time-based pay is still the foundation of most\nemployers' pay plans. Blue-collar and clerical workers get hourly or daily wages, for instance,\nand others, like managers or Web designers, tend to be salaried and paid by the week, month, or\nyear. The second direct payment option is to pay for performance. Piecework and sales\ncommissions are examples of performance-based compensation. Developing compensation plans\nfor managers or professionals is similar in many respects to developing plans for any employee.\nThe basic aim is the same: to attract and keep good employees. Managerial jobs tend to stress\nharder to quantify factors like judgment and problem solving more than do production and\nclerical jobs. There is also more emphasis on paying managers and professionals based on\nresults—based on their performance or on what they can do—rather than on the basis of static\njob demands like working conditions. So, job evaluation, although still important, usually plays a\nsecondary role to non-salary issues like bonuses, incentives, market rates, and benefits.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 1, 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.1 List the basic factors determining pay rates.\n24\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n62) What are the advantages for employers of claiming that someone doing work for them is an\nindependent contractor rather than an employee? What generally makes a worker classified as an\n\"independent contractor\"?\nAnswer: There are many advantages to organizations. The Fair Labor Standards Act does not\napply to independent contractors. The employer does not have to pay unemployment\ncompensation, payroll taxes, Social Security taxes, or city, state, and federal income taxes.\nIn general, an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or\ndirect only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done. However,\nthere is no single rule or test. Instead, the courts will look at the total situation. The major\nconsideration is this: The more the employer controls what the worker does and how he or she\ndoes it, the more likely it is that the courts will find the worker to be an employee, not an\nindependent contractor.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 1\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.1 List the basic factors determining pay rates.\n63) What are your compensation options if you are an employer who needs to transfer an\nemployee from a low cost-of-living area to a high cost-of-living area?\nAnswer: Employers have different ways of handling cost-of-living differentials. One is to give\nthe transferred person a nonrecurring payment in a lump sum amount. Another is to pay a\ndifferential for ongoing costs in addition to a one-time allocation. Others simply raise the\nemployee's base salary.\nFor international transfers, companies can go with a home-based or host-based salary plan.\nWith a home-based salary plan, an international transferee's base salary reflects his or her home\ncountry's salary. The employer then adds allowances for cost-of-living differences–housing and\nschooling costs, for instance. This is a reasonable approach for short-term assignments, and\navoids the problem of having to change the employee's base salary every time he or she moves.\nIn the host-based plan, the firm ties the international transferee's base salary to the host country's\nsalary structure. In other words, the manager from New York who is sent to France would have\nhis or her base salary changed to the prevailing base salary for that position in France, rather than\nkeep the New York base salary. The firm usually tacks on cost-of-living, housing, schooling, and\nother allowances here as well.\nMost multinational enterprises set expatriates' salaries according to the home-based salary plan.\nDifficulty: Moderate\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 1\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.1 List the basic factors determining pay rates.\n25\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n64) Explain the equity theory of motivation. What are the four forms of equity?\nAnswer: Equity theory states that people are strongly motivated to maintain a balance between\nwhat they perceive as their inputs or contributions and their rewards. If a person perceives an\ninequity, a tension or drive will develop in the person's mind and the person will be motivated to\nreduce or eliminate the tension and perceived inequity. The four forms are external, internal,\nindividual, and procedural. External equity refers to how a job's pay rate in one company\ncompares to the job's pay rate in other companies. Internal equity refers to how fair the job's pay\nrate is when compared to other jobs within the same company. Individual equity refers to the\nfairness of an individual's pay as compared with what his or her co-workers are earning for the\nsame or very similar jobs within the company, based on each individual's performance.\nProcedural equity refers to the perceived fairness of the processes and procedures used to make\ndecisions regarding the allocation of pay.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 1\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.1 List the basic factors determining pay rates.\n65) Which of the following is used to anchor the employer's pay scale?",

In a brief essay, explain the point\nmethod of job evaluation and why it is problematic for firms in regards to comparable worth.\nAnswer: The point method is a quantitative technique. It involves identifying (1) several\ncompensable factors, each having several degrees, as well as (2) the degree to which each of\nthese factors is present in the job. Assume there are five degrees of \"responsibility\" a job could\ncontain. Further, assume you assign a different number of points to each degree of each factor.\nOnce the evaluation committee determines the degree to which each compensable factor (like\n\"responsibility\" and \"effort\") is present in the job, it can calculate a total point value for the job\nby adding up the corresponding points for each factor. The result is a quantitative point rating for\neach job. Comparable worth has implications for job evaluation. Virtually every comparable\nworth case that reached a court involved the use of the point method of job evaluation. By\nassigning points to dissimilar jobs, point plans facilitate comparability ratings among different\njobs. Perhaps the wisest approach is for employers to price their jobs as they see fit (with or\nwithout point plans), but to ensure that women have equal access to all jobs. In other words,\neliminate the wage discrimination issue by eliminating sex-segregated jobs..\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 2\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.2 Define and give an example of how to conduct a job evaluation.\n82) Which of the following is NOT one of the compensable factors emphasized in the Equal Pay\nAct?",

Discuss the similarities and\ndifferences between job evaluations conducted for managerial positions and lower level positions\nat a firm.\nAnswer: Job evaluation aims to determine a job's relative worth. The job evaluation is a formal\nand systematic comparison of jobs to determine the worth of one job relative to another. Job\nevaluation eventually results in a wage or salary structure or hierarchy (this shows the pay rate\nfor various jobs or groups of jobs). The basic principle of job evaluation is this: Jobs that require\ngreater qualifications, more responsibilities, and more complex job duties should receive more\npay than jobs with lesser requirements. Many employers use job evaluation for pricing\nmanagerial jobs in most large firms. The basic approach is to classify all executive and\nmanagement positions into a series of grades, each with a salary range. As with non-managerial\njobs, one alternative is to rank the executive and management positions in relation to each other,\ngrouping those of equal value. However, firms also use the job classification and point\nevaluation methods, with compensable factors like position scope, complexity, and difficulty.\nJob analysis, salary surveys, and the fine-tuning of salary levels around wage curves also play\nroles.\nDifficulty: Hard\nChapter: 11\nObjective: 2, 4\nAACSB: Analytical Thinking\nLearning Outcome: 11.4 Explain how to price managerial and professional jobs.\n36\nCopyright © 2017 Pearson Education, Inc.\n\n94) What are the primary factors involved in determining compensation for a firm's CEO? What\nreasons best explain compensation reductions for top executives in recent years?\nAnswer: For a CEO position, job evaluation typically has little relevance. One recent study\nconcluded that three main factors: job complexity (span of control, the number of functional\ndivisions over which the executive has direct responsibility, and management level), the\nemployer's ability to pay (total profit and rate of return), and the executive's human capital\n(educational level, field of study, work experience) accounted for about two-thirds of executive\ncompensation variance. There are various reasons why boards are clamping down on executive\npay. The Dodd-Frank law of 2010 requires American companies give shareholders a \"say on\npay.\" Law firms are filing class-action suits demanding information from companies about their\nsenior executives' pay decisions. As of 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nrequired filing more compensation-related information, including a detailed listing of all\nindividual \"perks\" or benefits if they total more than $100,000. As of 2005, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board required that most public companies recognize as an expense the\nfair value of the stock options they grant.
